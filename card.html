			<p class="interesting_fact">Like humans, puppies are born without teeth. However, they can't hear, see or smell! Puppies don't open their eyes or begin to hear until they're 9 to 12 days old. They can't smell until three weeks post birth.</p>

			<p class="description">A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb (0.45–1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 15–23 lb (6.8–10.4 kg). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.</p>
